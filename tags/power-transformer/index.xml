      <description>S11-M series fully sealed oil-immersed power transformer has the advantages of low loss, low noise and high efficiency, which can achieve good energy saving effect and reduce pollution. Compared with the ordinary oil-immersed transformer, the fully-sealed transformer cancels the oil storage tank, and the change of oil volume is automatically adjusted and compensated by the elasticity of the corrugated sheet of the corrugated oil tank.</description>

      <description>S9-M-10kV three-phase oil-immersed fully sealed power transformer is different from ordinary oil-immersed transformers. It cancels the oil storage tank, and the corrugated plate heat sink of the oil tank body is used for heat dissipation and cooling. Its elastic expansion and contraction compensates for the volume of the oil. increase or decrease.  </description>

      <description>Resin insulated dry-type transformers are our company&amp;#39;s introduction of foreign advanced technology, and independently developed SCB10 and SCB11 series thin-insulated dry-type transformers with fillers. Because the coils are encapsulated by epoxy resin, they are flame retardant, fireproof, explosion-proof, maintenance-free, and pollution-free. , Small size, can be directly installed in the load center.</description>
