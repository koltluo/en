      <description>The online soft starter cabinet uses three-phase parallel thyristors as voltage regulators, which are connected between the power supply and the motor stator. Such a circuit is a three-phase fully controlled bridge rectifier circuit. When using a soft starter to start the motor, the output voltage of the thyristor gradually increases, and the motor gradually accelerates until the thyristor is fully turned on, and the motor works on the mechanical characteristics of the rated voltage to achieve smooth start, reduce the starting current, and avoid starting overcurrent tripping. </description>

      <description>The vector frequency converter is a power control device that uses frequency conversion technology and microelectronics technology to control the AC motor by changing the frequency of the motor&amp;#39;s operating power supply. The frequency converter is mainly composed of rectification, filtering, inverter, braking unit, drive unit, detection unit, micro processing unit etc. The frequency converter adjusts the voltage and frequency of the output power supply by switching off the internal GBT, and provides the required power supply voltage according to the actual needs of the motor, thereby achieving the purpose of energy saving and adjustment. </description>

      <description>This series of soft starters is an external bypass type, with a structure design of six inputs and three outputs. It is small and exquisite, and has a complete motor comprehensive protection function. The complete set of cabinets does not need an external protector, but it must be used with an external AC contactor. , After the soft starter is started, the AC contactor runs at full pressure, the product is more stable and reliable, and has a long service life.This product is widely used in the starting control of transmission equipment, fans, pumps, crushers and other loads, and the product complies with GB14048.6-2016 </description>
